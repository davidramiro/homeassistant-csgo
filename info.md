## Setup - CS:GO

CS:GO has an integrated game state reporting engine that we will use no update Home Assistant.

The configuration will be added to your CS:GO config directory.
[How to find my config directory](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration#Locating_CS:GO_Install_Directory)

Open that directory and add a file called **gamestate_integration_homeassistant.cfg**.

Add the following content and replace the "uri" with the one copied during the integration setup:

```

{
 "uri" "https://hooks.nabu.casa/xyz"
 "timeout" "5.0"
 "buffer" "0.1"
 "throttle" "0.5"
 "heartbeat" "15.0"
 "data"
 {
   "round"          "1" // round phase, bomb state and round winner
   "player_state"   "1" // player state (used for health)
 }
